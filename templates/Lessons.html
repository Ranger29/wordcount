                <p>Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. What, what? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)â€¦tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Yeah okay.(Workshop) (Marty is rewinding the video he shot of the time travel test with 1985 Doc.) Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. (He holds up a crude drawing of the flux capacitor.) Flux capacitor.Can we make it? We'll have to cut it off at Coyote Pass! (They quickly get on their horses but before they leave a little boy stops Marty.) Hey Mister...Mr. Eastwood. Here's your gun, Mister. (he gives the gun to Marty.) Thanks, kid. (He spots his Seamus standing in front of the Saloon. Seamus grins and rolls his hands into fists, faking a punch to show that he saw what Marty did.) Seamus! (Marty tosses him the gun and gun belt.) Worth $12, never been used.</p>
